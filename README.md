# Fancy Task Board
## Description
This project is a simple task board application designed to help project teams manage tasks efficiently. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It utilizes the Day.js library to handle date-related functionalities. The task board allows users to add, manage, and track the progress of project tasks.
## User Story
As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize, I want a task board so that I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress, and track overall project progress accordingly.
## Acceptance Criteria 
- Task Display: When the task board is opened, the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress states: Not Yet Started, In Progress, and Completed.

- Color Coding: Each task is color-coded to indicate its deadline status: yellow for nearing the deadline and red for overdue.

- Task Creation: Users can define a new task by entering the title, description, and deadline date in a modal dialog.

- Task Saving: Upon clicking the save button, the task properties are saved in localStorage.

- Task Drag and Drop: Tasks can be dragged to different progress columns, updating their progress state, which persists after refreshing.

- Task Deletion: Clicking the delete button removes a task from the board, and it will not reappear after refreshing.

- Data Persistence: Saved tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

1- Dynamic Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with ease.

2- Drag-and-Drop Interface: Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality to update task progress.

3- Deadline Alerts: Visual alerts for tasks nearing or past their deadlines.

4- Local Storage: Persistent data storage using localStorage.

## Technical Requirements

* Day.js Library: Utilized for handling date-related operations.

* jQuery: Powers dynamic updates to HTML and CSS.
